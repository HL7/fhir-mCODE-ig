# SUPPRESS US CORE COMPLIANCE WARNINGS.  For STU2, exceptions to US Core parent profiles was approved by Cross-Group Projects Work Group on 1/28/2021 Floyd Eisenberg/Brett Marquard: 28-0-1. See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30707. For STU3, exceptions to US Core parent profiles was approved by the Cross-Group Projects Work Group on 2/9/2023 Saul Kravitz/Floyd Eisenberg: 23-0-2. See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-40383.  A variance for an additional Observation added in STU3 was approved by the Cross-Group Projects Work Group on 8/10/23.  See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-41710.
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Observation derive from one of the base US profiles

# TG263 is a  proprietary codesystem used in Radiotherapy.  The whole point of conceptmaps is to make it easy to transition to the ValueSets used in this IG. The codesystem identifers TRX, IJE and MRE are not proper codesystem URIs.  Work is underway to define proper URIs that will be included in future versions of this IG.
WARNING: ConceptMap/TG263CM: ConceptMap.group[0].source: The Source Code System TG263 is not fully defined and populated, and no sourceScope is specified, so the source code checking will not be performed
INFORMATION: ConceptMap/TG263CM: ConceptMap: The concept map has too many codes to validate (673)

# Use of UCUM inherited from Genomics IG (nothing we can do about it)
WARNING: Observation/gx-genomic-tmb: Observation.value.ofType(Quantity): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {Base} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked, and the Quantity.unit SHOULD contain the annotation
