| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy - Temporary Placement | Radiation treatment that irradiates a treatment volume with temporarily placed radiation sources delivering low dose rates (typically less than or equal to 2 Gy/hour).  |  Low dose rate brachytherapy using temporary radioactive source (procedure)  | 1156708005 |
| Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy - Permanent Placemet | Radiation treatment that irradiates a treatment volume with permanently placed radiation sources delivering low dose rates (typically less than or equal to 2 Gy/hour).  |  Internal radiotherapy - permanent seeds (procedure) | 169359004 |
| Pulsed Dose Rate Brachytherapy | Internal or surface radiation treatment that irradiates a treatment volume in short pulses (typically 10 to 30 minutes in every hour) with a stronger source than low dose rate brachytherapy (typically treatment rates up to 3 Gy/hour).  | Pulsed dose rate brachytherapy (procedure)   | 1156384006 |
| High Dose Rate Brachytherapy | Internal or surface radiation treatment that irradiates a treatement volume with high dose rates of radiation (typically greater than 12 Gy/hour).  | High dose brachytherapy (procedure)    | 394902000|
| Electronic Brachytherapy | A modality of internal or surface radiation that uses X-ray sources instead of radionuclides to deliver high rates of radiation.  | High dose rate electronic brachytherapy (procedure)  | 438629002 |
