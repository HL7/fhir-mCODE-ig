<h1><a name="labsVitals.html"></a>Laboratory Results and Vital Signs</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Core Laboratory Results</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of laboratory tests that might be relevant to an individual with cancer. In mCODE, the scope has been limited to two core laboratory panels. The initial mCODE release includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="StructureDefinition-obf-lab-CBCWAutoDifferentialPanel.html">Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Automated Differential</a></li>
    <li><a href="StructureDefinition-obf-lab-ComprehensiveMetabolic2000SerumOrPlasmaPanel.html">Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These core diagnostic labs are modeled separately from cancer-specific serum and tissue-based prognostic factors which in some cases, are essential for cancer diagnosis and staging. These prognostic factors are modeled as a dedicated FHIR profile for tumor marker observations.</p>
<p>Note: Although mCODE defines its own laboratory profiles, if and when detailed laboratory profiles are standardized in a widely-accepted IG, mCODE will likely switch over to those profiles.</p>

<h2><a name="TumorMarkers"></a>Tumor Marker Tests</h2>

<p>Tumor markers are key prognostic factors in calculating cancer staging, identifying treatment options, and monitoring progression of disease. This IG distinguishes tumor markers from genetic markers as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Tumor markers</b> can be indicators that result from the existence of cancer process. For example, an abnormal increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is a prognostic factor for prostate cancer. Other tumor markers include estrogen receptor (ER) status, progresterone receptor (PR) status, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, among others.</a></li>
    <li><b>Genetic markers</b> are measured at the DNA, RNA, or chromosomal level. Genetic tests which evaluate molecular markers include but are not limited to in-situ hybridization tests (e.g.: FISH, CISH), sequencing tests (e.g.: Sanger, NGS), whole genome and exome tests, and karyotype. Genetic markers are addressed in the <a href="genomics.html">Genomics Reporting</a> section.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the profile <a href="StructureDefinition-onco-core-TumorMarkerTest.html">TumorMarkerTest</a> for full details.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Vital Signs</h2>
<p>By definition, vital signs are measurements of the most essential, or "vital" body functions. <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/vitalsigns.html">Traditionally</a>, vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. More recently, height and weight have been included. Only BP, height and weight are included in mCode because these are the most critical to assessment and treatment.</p>
<p>The vital sign profiles defined by mCODE are consistent with the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation-vitalsigns.html">FHIR vital sign profiles</a>, which are incorporated by reference into <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/">US Core v3</a>. The difference between FHIR and mCODE vital signs is that mCODE provides for reporting of preconditions, body positions, blood pressure method, and blood pressure body location, with appropriate value sets. The vital signs model in mCODE is aligned with the Vital Signs Implementation Guide being developed in cooperation with the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/Special/Committees/cimi/index.cfm">Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI) Work Group</a>. 
</p>
<p>Note: Although mCODE defines its own vital signs profiles, if and when detailed vital signs profiles are standardized in a widely-accepted FHIR IG, mCODE will likely switch over to those profiles.</p>
