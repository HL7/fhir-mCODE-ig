### Usage

Using AJCC terminology, examples of T categories include 'ycTX', used for post-therapy clinical staging if the tumor primary tumor cannot be evaluated, 'pT0', denoting there is no evidence of a primary tumor, and 'pTis', referencing carcinoma in situ (with some cancer-specific exceptions). Other T categories refer to increasing size of the primary tumor. Please note allowable T categories may vary between clinical, pathologic, and other classifications, and the T category prefix must align with Observation.code. The full set of allowable clinical, pathologic, and other (recurrence/retreatment/autopsy) T categories, along with current descriptions, can be accessed through the AJCC Staging Manual and any applicable updates and corrections, as well as the AJCC API.
