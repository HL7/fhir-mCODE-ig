{% raw %} <li><a href="StructureDefinition-mcode-cancer-condition-parent.html">Cancer Condition Parent</a> Abstract parent class for describing a primary or secondary metastatic neoplastic diseases, or individual tumors.</li>
 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-mcode-cancer-disease-status.html">Cancer Disease Status</a> A clinician's qualitative judgment on the current trend of the cancer, e.g., whether it is stable, worsening (progressing), or improving (responding). The judgment may be based a single type or multiple kinds of evidence, such as imaging data, assessment of symptoms, tumor markers, laboratory data, etc.

Note: The LOINC code chosen to represent this observation (LOINC 88040-1, Response to cancer treatment) does not precisely match the meaning of this profile, but it is the closest available LOINC code at the present time. It is acknowledged that the disease status is different than the status of the disease due to treatment, although in the context of an oncologist visit, disease status can mean response to treatment for patients under their care. However, the LOINC code 88041-2 is more granular than the definition of the profile because cancer disease status is observable regardless of whether the patient is under treatment. The plan is to request a new LOINC code that represents cancer disease status, as it is defined here, and replace the current LOINC code with the new code before normative publication of mCODE.</li>
 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-mcode-cancer-genetic-variant.html">Cancer Genetic Variant</a> Records an alteration in the most common DNA nucleotide sequence. The term variant can be used to describe an alteration that may be benign, pathogenic, or of unknown significance. The term variant is increasingly being used in place of the term mutation.</li>
 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-mcode-cancer-genomics-report.html">Cancer Genomics Report</a> Genetic analysis summary report. The report may include one or more tests, with two distinct test types. The first type is a targeted mutation test, where a specific mutation on a specific gene is tested for. The result is either positive or negative for that mutation. The second type is a more general test for variants. This type of test returns the identity of variants found in a certain region of the genome.
The identity of non-genomic laboratory tests is typically represented by a LOINC code. However, many genetic tests and panels do not have LOINC codes, although some might have an identifier in NCBI Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), a central location for voluntary submission of genetic test information by providers. To identify the diagnostic report, the name of the report must be in the text sub-field of the code structure. If there is a coded identifier from GTR, LOINC, or other source, then it should be included into the the code sub-field of the code structure. If there is no suitable code, the code can be omitted.</li>

 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-mcode-cancer-related-radiation-procedure.html">Cancer-Related Radiation Procedure</a> A radiological treatment addressing a cancer condition. The scope of this profile has been narrowed to cancer-related procedures by constraining the ReasonReference and ReasonCode to cancer conditions.

Conformance note: If an ICD-10-PCS code is used in the code attribute, and there is a semantically equivalent SNOMED CT or CPT code, the resulting Procedure instance will not be compliant with [US Core Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/index.html)</li>
 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-mcode-cancer-related-surgical-procedure.html">Cancer-Related Surgical Procedure</a> A surgical action addressing a cancer condition. The scope of this profile has been narrowed to cancer-related procedures by constraining the ReasonReference and ReasonCode to cancer conditions.

 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-mcode-cancer-stage-parent.html">Cancer Stage Parent</a> Abstract parent class for members of cancer staging panels. Cancer panel members must include a timing element and staging system, and focus on a cancer disorder. Specific realizations will have value sets specific to certain staging systems.</li>
 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-mcode-comorbid-condition.html">Comorbid Condition</a> A comorbidity refers to one or more diseases or conditions that occur along with another condition in the same person at the same time. Conditions considered comorbidities are often long-term or chronic conditions. Comorbidities are defined relative to an index disease and may be categorical, rather than described in full detail. The comorbid condition class provides comorbidity codes corresponding the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. Conformance note: If an ICD-10-CM code is used for the code attribute, and a semantically equivalent SNOMED code is available, the resulting instance will not be compliant with US Core Profiles.</li>

It can be used to compare the effectiveness of different therapies and to help assess the prognosis of certain patients, such as those with certain cancers. The KPS score ranges from 0 to 100 in intervals of 10. Higher scores are associated with better functional status, with 100 representing no symptoms or evidence of disease, and 0 representing death.</li>

Cancers that are not clearly secondary (i.e., of uncertain origin or behavior) should be documented as primary.

Cancer staging information summarized in this profile should reflect the most recent staging assessment on the patient, and should be updated if and when there is a new staging assessment. Past staging assessments will be preserved in instances of the TNMClinicalStageGroup and/or TNMPathologicalStageGroup, which refer back to PrimaryCancerCondition.

 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-mcode-tumor-marker.html">Tumor Marker</a> The result of a tumor marker test. Tumor marker tests are generally used to guide cancer treatment decisions and monitor treatment, as well as to predict the chance of recovery and cancer recurrence. A tumor marker is a substance found in tissue or blood or other body fluids that may be a sign of cancer or certain benign (noncancer) conditions. Most tumor markers are made by both normal cells and cancer cells, but they are made in larger amounts by cancer cells. A tumor marker may help to diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Examples of tumor markers include CA-125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in colon cancer), and PSA (in prostate cancer). Tumor markers differ from genetic markers in that they are measured at the levels of the protein and substance post-RNA protein synthesis. (Definition adapted from: [NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/tumor-marker-test) and [Cancer.Net](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/diagnosing-cancer/tests-and-procedures/tumor-marker-tests)).

Implementation note: The data value for TumorMarker has cardinality is 0..1 (required if known) because when the test result is indeterminate, no quantitative data value will be reported. Instead, the reason for the null value will be reported in the DataAbsentReason field.</li>
