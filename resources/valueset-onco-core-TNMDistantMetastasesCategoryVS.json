The full set of allowable clinical and pathologic M categories, along with its current descriptions, can be accessed through the AJCC Staging Manual and any applicable updates and corrections, as well as the AJCC API.\n\n* SNOMED CT: The SNOMED CT US Edition has content related to the M category under the hierarchy of 385380006 &#039;Metastasis category finding&#039;, such as 30893008 &#039;M0 category&#039; and 443841006 &#039;pM1a category&#039;. If using SNOMED CT to store M category findings, the use of codes that do not contain descriptions of the categories, such as the examples provided, is encouraged, as stage finding codes in SNOMED CT may not be up-to-date with current AJCC guidance.
