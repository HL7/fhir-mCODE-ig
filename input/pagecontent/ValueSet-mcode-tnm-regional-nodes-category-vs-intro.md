### Usage

In AJCC terminology, examples of N categories include 'ycN0', for post-therapy clinical staging indicating no evidence of lymph node involvement, and 'pN1', indicating regional lymph node involvement to a small extent, with specific thresholds for the lymph node groups and number of lymph nodes involved. Other N categories refer to increasing lymph node involvement. Please note allowable N categories may vary between clinical, pathologic, and other classifications, and the N category prefix must align with Observation.code. The full set of allowable clinical, pathologic, and other (recurrence/retreatment/autopsy) N categories, along with current descriptions, can be accessed through the AJCC Staging Manual and any applicable updates and corrections, as well as the AJCC API.
