Tumor marker tests are generally used to guide cancer treatment decisions and monitor treatment, as well as to predict the chance of recovery and cancer recurrence. A tumor marker is a substance found in tissue or blood or other body fluids that may be a sign of cancer or certain benign (noncancer) conditions. Most tumor markers are made by both normal cells and cancer cells, but they are made in larger amounts by cancer cells. A tumor marker may help to diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Examples of tumor markers include CA-125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in colon cancer), and PSA (in prostate cancer). Tumor markers differ from genetic markers in that they are measured at the levels of the protein and substance post-RNA protein synthesis.
