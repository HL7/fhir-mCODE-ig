<h1><a name="outcomes"></a>Outcomes Reporting</h1>

<p>Recording outcomes of cancer treatment in mCODE involves two data elements: disease status and date of death. Other common outcome measures, such as progression-free survival, time to recurrence, and overall survival, can be derived from time-indexed observations of disease status. The date of diagnosis is also required for some derived measures (see <a href="disease.html">Disease</a>).</p>

<p>At this time, mCODE does not include patient reported outcomes.</p>

<h2>Disease Status</h2>
<p>Formal recording of disease status is often limited to clinical trials, involving precise criteria such as <a href="https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/docs/recist_guideline.pdf">RECIST</a>. The lack of outcome data outside of trials greatly limits the application of real-world data. Disease status information is rarely found in structured form in EHRs. If recorded at all, the information is found in clinical notes, which is of limited usefulness.</p>
<p>mCODE asks for disease progression to be recorded in structured form as part of patient encounters. In mCODE, disease status is defined as "A clinician's qualitative judgment on the current trend of the cancer, e.g., whether it is stable, worsening (progressing), or improving (responding). The judgment may be based a single type or multiple kinds of evidence, such as imaging data, assessment of symptoms, tumor markers, laboratory data, etc." In other words, the disease status is an assessment by the oncologist that synthesizes all currently available information about the patient. The <a href="http://icaredata.org/">ICAREdataâ„¢ Project</a> is conducting a study in association with a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which aims to demonstrate the ability to calculate equivalent clinical trial endpoints using computable clinical treatment data.
</p>

<h2>Date of Death</h2>
<p>Date of death data can be obtained from several sources outside of the clinical setting. If available in the EHR, it can be reported through via mCODE, but more likely, it will be filled in from vital records, after the last clinical interaction.</p>
