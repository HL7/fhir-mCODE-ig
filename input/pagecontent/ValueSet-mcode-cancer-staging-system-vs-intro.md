### Usage

The codes in this value set represent common TNM staging systems. Non-TNM staging systems are not currently represented in mCODE, reflecting mCODE's current focus on solid tumors. This is not meant to constrain which staging systems are used. The bindings to this value set are extensible, meaning codes outside the value set can be used, if needed.
