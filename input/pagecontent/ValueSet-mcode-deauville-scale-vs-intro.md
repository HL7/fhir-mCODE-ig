### Usage
The following information from [this article](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/deauville-five-point-scale?lang=us) describes the values. The scale ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 is best and 5 is the worst. Each lesion is rated independently:

* 1 means there was no uptake or no residual uptake (when used interim) 
* 2 means there was slight uptake, but equal to or below blood pool (mediastinum) 
* 3 means there was uptake above mediastinal, but below or equal to uptake in the liver
* 4 means there was uptake slightly to moderately higher than liver
* 5 means there was markedly increased uptake or any new lesion (on response evaluation)
