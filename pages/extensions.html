The orientation element is part of BodyLocation, a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.

* Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.
* Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.
* Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
1. Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and
2. Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.

Note that BodyLocation is a data type (a reusable structure), not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).{% endcapture %}{{ md_text | markdownify }}</td>

Cancers that are not clearly secondary (i.e., of uncertain origin or behavior) should be documented as primary.

Cancer staging information summarized in this profile should reflect the most recent staging assessment on the patient, and should be updated if and when there is a new staging assessment. Past staging assessments will be preserved in instances of the TNMClinicalStageGroup and/or TNMPathologicalStageGroup, which refer back to PrimaryCancerCondition.

Conformance note: For the code attribute, to be compliant with [US Core Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3/index.html), SNOMED-CT must be used unless there is no suitable code, in which case ICD-10-CM can be used.{% endcapture %}{{ md_text | markdownify }}</td>
