### Usage

GenomicVariant SHOULD be sent as part of a GenomicsReport and MAY be sent as a standalone observation.

### Conformance

Observation resources associated with an [in-scope patient] with `Observation.code` LOINC `69548-6` MUST conform to this profile. Beyond this requirement, a producer of resources SHOULD ensure that any resource instance associated with an [in-scope patient] that would reasonably be expected to conform to this profile SHOULD be published in this form.
