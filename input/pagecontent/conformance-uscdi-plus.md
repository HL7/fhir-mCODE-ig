The Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy (ASTP), formerly the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC), is developing the USCDI+ for Cancer data elements required for cancer reporting and the Enhancing Oncology Model (EOM).  This is an important development that deserves early guidance on how mCODE can support this initiative as quickly as possible.

At the time of mCODE STU4 IG development, USCDI+ for Cancer just completed its comment period, so the proposed data elements may still be subject to change.  However, the current list of data elements suggests a higher priority should be applied to certain profiles within the mCODE data model.  This set of potential higher priority data elements have been collected into a group called "mCODE Core".  

The diagram below highlights the set of "mCORE Core" profiles within mCODE, as of October 10, 2024, that implementers may want to prioritize to meet the USCDI+ for Cancer proposal.

Prioritizing the development of the highlighted profiles first provides a pathway for quickly supporting the USCDI+ for Cancer data elements while providing a rational stepping-stone towards full mCODE implementation.  Implementers should consider this option in their development plans.
