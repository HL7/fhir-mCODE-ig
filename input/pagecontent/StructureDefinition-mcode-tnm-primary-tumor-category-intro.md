### Conformance

Observation resources associated with an [in-scope patient] with `Observation.code` LOINC `21905-5`, `21899-0`, or `21911-3` MUST conform to this profile. Beyond this requirement, a producer of resources SHOULD ensure that any resource instance associated with an in-scope patient that would reasonably be expected to conform to this profile SHOULD be published in this form.
