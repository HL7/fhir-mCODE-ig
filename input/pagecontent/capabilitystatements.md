Differing Capability Statements in mCODE are associated with different methods of determining which patients are “in-scope” for mCODE (meaning cancer patients whose data is presented or exchanged with the intention of conforming to mCODE). For further information, see [Identifying In-Scope Patients](conformance-patients.html).

The following Capability Statements are defined in mCODE:

* For the information sender:  
  * [mcode-sender-cancer-conditions-then-patients]
  * [mcode-sender-patients-and-cancer-conditions]
  * [mcode-sender-patient-bundle]
  * [mcode-sender-patients-in-group]
  * [mcode-sender-patients-with-cancer-condition]

* For the information receiver:
  * [mcode-receiver-cancer-conditions-then-patients]
  * [mcode-receiver-patients-and-cancer-conditions]
  * [mcode-receiver-patient-bundle]
  * [mcode-receiver-patients-in-group]
  * [mcode-receiver-patients-with-cancer-condition]
