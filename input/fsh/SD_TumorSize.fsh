/* Commenting out MultifocalTumor observation for now
Issues to consider further: 
1) Does this rise to the level of "minimal"?
2) You were missing Observation.code that says what is being observed.
3) Is this an Observation or a Condition? Conditions are uni-valued findings, while Observations need a question (code) and an answer set (value[x]). Observations on a TumorSpecimen are not Conditions although it is arguable that a multifocal tumor in the body could be modeled as a Condition.
4) If this is modeled as an Observation, then what is the question and what are the possible answers? Are we playing Jeopardy where the answer is "multi-focal"? Or is the question something about morphology, and "multi-focal" is among the possible answers? 
5) I know we convinced ourselves otherwise, but we shouldn't forget the option of allowing a value set for Tumor.morphology (perhaps by slicing Tumor.morphology and fixing the first code.)
