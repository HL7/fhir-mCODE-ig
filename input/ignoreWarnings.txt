# Use of UCUM inherited from Genomics IG (nothing we can do about it)
WARNING: Observation/gx-genomic-tmb: Observation.value.ofType(Quantity): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {Base} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked, and the Quantity.unit SHOULD contain the annotation

# This is a publisher induced issue.   The extension in question is introduced by the publisher, not sushi.   See https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/New.20ConceptMap.20Warning.20--.20induced.20by.20IG.20Publisher 
The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version 1.0 is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this element is [[BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)

# It might be a good idea...This is not an issue.
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://snomed.info/sct'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer. Using version 'null', found versions: 3.2.1, {{unversioned}}

# This is a temporary codesystem for codes not yet published in SNOMEDCT
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/snomed-requested-cs: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# This is a SNOMED limitation. These are the intended codes for this VS. Nothing we can change. 
INFORMATION: ValueSet/mcode-radiotherapy-treatment-location-vs: ValueSet.compose.include[0]: This SNOMED-CT based include has some concepts with semantic tags (FSN terms) and some without (preferred terms) - check that this is what is intended  (examples for FSN: [Aortic structure (body structure), Ascending aorta structure (body structure), Branch of brachiocephalic artery (body structure), Carotid artery structure (body structure), Structure of celiac artery (body structure)] and examples for no FSN: [Tumor bed (morphologic abnormality), Scar (morphologic abnormality), Vaginal cuff (morphologic abnormality)])
