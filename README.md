# mCODEâ„¢: Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements

mCODE provides both a common data language and an open-source, nonproprietary data model for interconnectivity across systems. This repository contains the source code for the mCODE Implementation Guide (IG).

## Building the IG

To build the IG locally, run `./_genonce.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `_genonce.bat` (Windows) from the top level folder.

### UML diagrams

To build the UML diagrams (in `input/images-source/`), you will need to be able to run [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com). This has [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) as a dependency.

On macOS:

1. Install Java if you don't already have it
2. `brew install graphviz`
3. Download `plantuml.jar` from <https://plantuml.com/download>
4. From the `input/images-source/` folder, run `java -jar /path/to/plantuml.jar -tsvg -o ../images/ some_model.puml`

    To convert all UML files at once, run `java -jar /path/to/plantuml.jar -tsvg -o ../images/ *.puml`

On Windows:

1. Install Java if you don't already have it
2. TODO
