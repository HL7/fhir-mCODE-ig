CodeSystem: CatchCodeCS
Id: mcode-catch-code-cs
Title: "mCODE Catch Codes"
Description: "Codes needed for positive identification of certain types of instances, more specifically, to uniquely associate instances with slices when they are used in bundles. The codes in this code system are used when a concept falls outside of the defined set of codes. They make it possible to use 'required' bindings where 'extensible' bindings would result an instance matching multiple slices and thus trigger validation errors."
* #PCC-OTHER "Other Primary Cancer Condition, Specify" "Code to be used when the desired concept is not represented base value set. This code represents the equivalent of 'Other, specify: _________'. Specify the additional concept as the second coding."
* #SCC-OTHER "Other Secondary Cancer Condition, Specify" "Code to be used when the desired concept is not represented base value set. This code represents the equivalent of 'Other, specify: _________'. Specify the additional concept as the second coding."
* #TMT-OTHER "Other Tumor Marker Test, Specify" "Code to be used when the desired concept is not represented base value set. This code represents the equivalent of 'Other, specify: _________'. Specify the additional concept as the second coding."
* #CD-OTHER "Other Cancer Disorder, Specify"  "Code to be used when the desired concept is not represented base value set. This code represents the equivalent of 'Other, specify: _________'. Specify the additional concept as the second coding."

CodeSystem: ResourceIdentifierCS
Id: mcode-resource-identifier-cs
Title: "mCODE Resource Identifier Code System"
Description: "Concepts describing instance types, to be used in the `code` element of instances. These codes were created because no appropriate concept could be found in established vocabularies. These concepts are analogous to LOINC codes for laboratory observations: they identify the type of thing an instance represents.

Please note that while these codes may imply conformance to the profiles that use them, they are not synonymous with profiles and do not serve the same purpose in a FHIR resource for several reasons:

1. An instance of a resource like Group, Observation, or Procedure may conform to multiple profiles, but may only have one 'type of thing' as determined by the value of `code` (which has a maximum cardinality of 1).
2. `Procedure.code`, `Observation.code`, and `Group.code` elements require a [CodeableConcept data type](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#CodeableConcept), which can be satisfied with a code from this code system. In contrast, a profile is identified with a [canonical URL](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.url), which is represented by a [URI data type](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#uri). In other words, a profile's canonical URL belongs in the `meta.profile` element, whereas the codes in this code system belong in `Resource.code` elements.
3. The same `code` can correspond to more than one profile (although not the case here)."

* #mcode-patient "mCODE Patient Group Resource" "Identifies a Group resource containing in-scope cancer patients that conforms to the MCODEPatientGroup profile."
* #mcode-radiotherapy-course-summary "Radiotherapy Course Summary Resource" "Identifies a Procedure resource that summarizes a radiotherapy treatment that conforms to the RadiotherapyCourseSummary profile." // USCRS-33292 - SNOMEDCT code requested
