### Usage

The following rules apply to this value set:

1. Select the most specific term appropriate for a given situation. For example, a permanent interstitial implant should be reported as INSTIT-PERM, not as INSTIT.
2. Select the term that best describes the technique used, even if that term does not capture every detail of the technique. For example, interstitial brachytherapy using iridium wire should be reported as INSTIT-TEMP because that category most closely aligns with the actual technique.

### Mapping Between Vocabularies

The concepts in this value set are drawn in priority order first from SNOMED CT (SCT), second from UMLS Metathesaurus, and lastly, from the [radiotherapy code system][RadiotherapyCS] defined in this Implementation Guide. Missing SNOMED CT codes have been submitted for approval.

The following table shows potential mappings. **This table may not be exhaustive and additional valid mappings may exist.**
