### Usage

Use these terms with the following definitions in mind:

* **Curative** is defined as any treatment meant to reduce or control a disease process, even if a 'cure' is not anticipated.
* **Palliative** treatments are intended to improve the quality of life, typically without concurrent curative treatments. Examples are pain medications or surgery to reduce the size (but not fully remove) a tumor close to the spine that could impact mobility. Palliative care most often refers specifically to end-of-life care.
* **Supportive** treatments do not treat or improve the underlying condition, but could extend life or be used in conjunction with curative treatments to improve patient comfort. They could be preventive drugs administered to preemptively manage side effects or toxicities from an anti-neoplastic (e.g.: G-CSFs to manage neutropenia, epoetins for anemia, dexamethasone for delayed nausea and vomiting, etc.). Supportive drugs could also be chemoprotective, or chemo-enhancing, and in some cases even included as part of the regimen even though the drug in itself is not an antineoplastic (e.g.: leucovorin is not an antineoplastic but an chemoprotectant oftentimes combined with the antineoplastics 5-FU and methotrexate).
* **Diagnostic** refers to procedures carried out to identify the nature of an illness
* **Preventive** refers to treatments designed to keep an illness or harm from occurring.
* **Screening** relates to procedures carried out to detect disease in individuals who do not have any symptoms of disease.
* **Guidance** relates to education and counselling, such as smoking cessation programs.
* **Forensic** in the medical context refers to procedures carried out to determine the cause of death.

These values appear in SNOMED CT under "Intents (nature of procedure values)" (code 363675004). There are certain terms under the same heading that were **not** included in this value set:

* **Prophylaxis** is essentially synonymous with preventive. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_healthcare> for the distinction between these terms.
* **Neo-adjuvant** deals with the timing of a treatment relative to other treatments, not the intent. SNOMED's classification of this term is questionable.
* **Adjuvant** also relates to the relative timing of a treatment. Again, SNOMED's classification of this term is questionable.
* **Adjunct** refers to a treatment accompanying or in support of another therapy. This is a situation or circumstance, not an intent.
