### Mapping Between Vocabularies

The concepts in this value set are drawn from SNOMED CT or the [radiotherapy code system][RadiotherapyCS] defined in this Implementation Guide. Additional SNOMED CT codes have been submitted for approval. NCI Thesaurus terms are shown for informational purposes.

The following table shows potential mappings. **This table may not be exhaustive and additional valid mappings may exist.**

| **Radiotherapy Code System** | **SNOMED CT**                  | **NCI Thesaurus**                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| LDR-TEMP  | none [1]  | none [2] |
| LDR-PERM  | none [1]  | none [2] |
| PDR | none | C116542 Pulsed-Dose Rate Brachytherapy |
| none |  394902000  High dose brachytherapy (procedure)   | C15651 High dose brachytherapy  |
| none | 438629002 "High dose rate electronic brachytherapy (procedure)" | none   |
| none | 440252007 Administration of radiopharmaceutical (procedure) | none [3] |

**Notes:**

1. The sound-alike term, *228868000 Low dose rate brachytherapy (observable entity)*, should not be mapped because it represents the dose rate given — the actual quantity, not the procedure.
2. The term *C85254 Low-Dose Rate Brachytherapy* is broader.
3. The sound-alike term, *C69290 Radiopharmaceutical Volume Administered*, should not be mapped because it refers to the *amount* of radiopharmaceutical given to a subject, not the procedure.
