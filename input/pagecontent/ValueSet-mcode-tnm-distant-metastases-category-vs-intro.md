### Usage

In AJCC terminology, examples of M categories include 'cM0', denoting there is no evidence of distant metastases, and 'pM1', an indication that the cancer has metastasized. Please note allowable M categories may vary between clinical, pathologic, and other classifications, and the M category prefix must align with Observation.code. The full set of allowable clinical, pathologic, and other (recurrence/retreatment/autopsy) M categories, along with current descriptions, can be accessed through the AJCC Staging Manual and any applicable updates and corrections, as well as the AJCC API.
