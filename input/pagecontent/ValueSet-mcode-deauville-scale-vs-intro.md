### Usage
The following information from [this article](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/deauville-five-point-scale?lang=us) describes the values. The scale ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 is best and 5 is the worst. Each lesion is rated independently:

* **1:** There was no uptake or no residual uptake (when used interim) 
* **2:** There was slight uptake, but equal to or below blood pool (mediastinum) 
* **3:** There was uptake above mediastinal, but below or equal to uptake in the liver
* **4:** There was uptake slightly to moderately higher than liver
* **5:** There was markedly increased uptake or any new lesion (on response evaluation)

More information about the Deauville Scale can also be found in the [NCI Thesaurus](https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/pages/concept_details.jsf?dictionary=NCI_Thesaurus&version=24.07e&code=C99750).
