If the statement should be in John Doe's patient record, then John Doe is the subject of record. When there is no patient, the SubjectOfRecord can also be a location, group, or other entity that statement pertains to. For example, observations concerning a hospital ward would have a Location as the SubjectOfRecord.\n\nNote that the word 'Subject' is used here in the sense of a person or entity subjected to observations or actions, not subject as in a conceptual topic, like heart disease.",
