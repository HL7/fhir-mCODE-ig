        "definition": "A location or structure in the body, including tissues, regions, cavities, and spaces; for example, right elbow, or left ventricle of the heart. Body location is a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.\n+ Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.\n+ Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.\n+ Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:\n- Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and\n- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.\nNote that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).",

The source may identify another FHIR server, document, message, database, etc.\nFHIM: Identifies the computer system that created the medical record. This optional field may also be used to indicate that the medical record was originally created by a different organization from the one that is currently storing or utilizing the record in that the assigning authority of the Id could be set to that originating organization. This property is optional, as some systems will assume that all records that it contains originated in that system, however it is anticipated that it will become increasingly commonplace for records from multiple systems and organizations will be comingled in order to provide a complete picture of the patient's health record.",
