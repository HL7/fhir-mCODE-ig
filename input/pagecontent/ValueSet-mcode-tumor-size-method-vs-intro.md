### Usage

There are 3 broad categories of tumor size measurement methods:

1. Pathology
    - Macroscopic size from pathology report is represented by SCT `787377000` (\"Gross examination and sampling of tissue specimen (procedure)\")
    - Microscopic size from pathology report is represented by SCT `104157003` (\"Light microscopy (procedure)\")
2. Physical exam, represented by SCT `5880005` (\"Physical examination procedure (procedure)\")
3. Diagnostic imaging
    - Three imaging modalities commonly used for tumor sizing
       - Ultrasound represented by SCT `16310003`
       - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) represented by SCT `113091000`
       - Computerized axial tomography (CAT) represented by SCT `77477000`
    - Imaging modalities that are less commonly used for tumor sizing
        - Imaging represented by SCT `363679005`
