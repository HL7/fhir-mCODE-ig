# NOTE TO SELF: ONLY WARNINGS AND INFORMATION MESSAGES CAN BE SUPPRESSED, NOT ERRORS
# ONLY THE WARNING MESSAGE ITSELF NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS FILE, NOT THE ENTIRE CONTEXT

# SUPPRESS US CORE COMPLIANCE WARNINGS.  For STU2, exceptions to US Core parent profiles was approved by Cross-Group Projects Work Group on 1/28/2021 Floyd Eisenberg/Brett Marquard: 28-0-1. See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30707. For STU3, exceptions to US Core parent profiles was approved by the Cross-Group Projects Work Group on 2/9/2023 Saul Kravitz/Floyd Eisenberg: 23-0-2. See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-40383.  A variance for an additional Observation added in STU3 was approved by the Cross-Group Projects Work Group on 8/10/23.  See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-41710.
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Observation derive from one of the base US profiles
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Specimen derive from the core US profile
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on DiagnosticReport derive from one of the base US profiles

# TG263 is a  proprietary codesystem used in Radiotherapy.  The whole point of conceptmaps is to make it easy to transition to the ValueSets used in this IG. The codesystem identifers TRX, IJE and MRE are not proper codesystem URIs.  Work is underway to define proper URIs that will be included in future versions of this IG.
WARNING: ConceptMap/TG263CM: ConceptMap.group[0].source: The Source Code System TG263 is not fully defined and populated, and no sourceScope is specified, so the source code checking will not be performed

# UCUM Best Practice warning is inherited from Genomics Reporting IG and we can't change that
UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {Base} can be misleading. Best Practice is not to use annotations in the UCUM code, and rather to make sure that Quantity.unit is correctly human readable
