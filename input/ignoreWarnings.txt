# SUPPRESS US CORE COMPLIANCE WARNINGS.  For STU2, exceptions to US Core parent profiles was approved by Cross-Group Projects Work Group on 1/28/2021 Floyd Eisenberg/Brett Marquard: 28-0-1. See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30707. For STU3, exceptions to US Core parent profiles was approved by the Cross-Group Projects Work Group on 2/9/2023 Saul Kravitz/Floyd Eisenberg: 23-0-2. See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-40383.  A variance for an additional Observation added in STU3 was approved by the Cross-Group Projects Work Group on 8/10/23.  See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-41710.

# Value Set Too Large to Validate
The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed
The value set include has too many codes to validate (1,045), so each individual code has not been checked
Target Code System http://snomed.info/sct doesn't have all content (content = not-present), so the target codes cannot be checked

# Use of UCUM inherited from Genomics IG (nothing we can do about it)
WARNING: Observation/gx-genomic-tmb: Observation.value.ofType(Quantity): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {Base} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked, and the Quantity.unit SHOULD contain the annotation
