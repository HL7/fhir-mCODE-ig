### Usage

The codes in this value set represent common TNM staging systems. Non-TNM staging systems are not currently represented in mCODE, reflecting mCODE's current focus on solid tumors. This is not meant to constrain which staging systems are used. The bindings to this value set are extensible, meaning codes outside the value set can be used, if needed.

The codes themselves are drawn from both NCI Thesaurus and SNOMED CT, since the latter does not currently have a concept code denoting AJCC version 8, the most current version used for AJCC for cancer staging. AJCC is actively requesting the addition of new SNOMED CT concept code, although this process takes time.
