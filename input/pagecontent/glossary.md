| *Treatment Plan* | A data object which contains one set of complete and detailed parameters that define how to deliver radiotherapy treatments. | The parameters of a Treatment Plan include the dose to be delivered to volumes, the number of Fractions into which the treatment is subdivided, Modality, Technique, as well as the detailed device parameters required by a treatment device. Examples of device parameters are dose rate, field size, or irradiation angles The *Treatment Plan* covers one set of these parameters. To vary any parameter between Radiotherapy treatments, different *Treatment Plans* must be created and scheduled during a Course of treatment to achieve the expected pattern. Some parameters from distinct *Treatment Plans* are summarized in Phases or over a full Course of treatment to provide an overview. |
| *Modality*    |  The main type of radiation delivery such as photons, protons, or High Dose Rate brachytherapy.|  Modalities are not strictly differentiated along a single physical property, but in a way that makes sense in practical categorization. For teleradiotherapy (external beam radiotherapy) that is along the used particles, for brachytherapy, that is along the dose rate and placement. |
| *Technique*    |  The treatment delivery method such as Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy or Particle Spot Scanning. | The Technique defines how a certain Modality is applied. It therefore enables a more granular categorization of the treatment approach for a given Modality. |
| *Course* | Grouping that collects all radiation therapy treatments constituting an episode of care. This means all target volumes treated from first delivery of radiation in the *Course* until the physician believes they have treated all body sites in need of radiation therapy. | A *Course* can be divided into multiple *Phases* and can last for several months. For example, if there is a split *Course* for liver with 1 month in between, these are all part of the same *Course*. If treatment is started for one body site and then another is subsequently discovered and treated, the *Course* includes both. |
| *Phase* | A conceptual series of equivalent treatments (same nominal dose to the same set of target volumes with the same modality and technique). May use multiple Plans sequentially in case of plan adaptation, or in parallel if splitting plans for technical reasons. | *Phase* is an abstraction from *Treatment Plans* to allow for continuous counting of *Phase Fractions* and dose tracking across multiple Plans that together implement one series of treatments. In the simplest cases, *Phase* corresponds 1:1 to *Plan*.  To realize more complex treatment patterns than a single series of equivalent treatments and vary targets, delivered dose, modality, or technique between sessions, a *Course* can be structured as multiple *Phases*. Often *Phases* are sequential in time, but they may occur in parallel, overlapping, or in alternating temporal patterns. Some systems record a separate *Phase* for each target volume. This is possible but not required in this model. |
| Fraction | Each Radiation Therapy *Plan* is treated in a series of Fractions.  | The term Fraction is also commonly used in the context of a *Phase*, but here we use the separate concept of *Phase Fraction* for clarity when referring to subdivisions of a *Phase.* |
|*Phase Fraction* | Each *Treatment Phase* is subdivided into a series *Phase Fractions*.  | The term *Phase Fraction* is used to clearly differentiate from *Fractions* of a *Treatment Plan*. However, if the context of a *Phase* is clear, then this is often just called *Fraction*. If a *Phase* is implemented by multiple plans that are treated after each other, e.g. in case of plan adaptation, then each *Fraction* of the *Phase* corresponds to one *Fraction* of a *Plan*. If multiple *Plans* are treated in parallel to implement the same *Phase*, then a *Fraction* of the *Phase* contains the *Fractions* of all those *Treatment Plans*.|
| *Session* | Each *Course* is treated in a series of *Sessions*. A *Session* is the period between when the patient enters the treatment room and when they leave it.| In one *Session*, a *Fraction* of one Radiation Therapy *Plan* or different *Fractions* from different Radiation Therapy *Plans* may be treated, depending on how the treatments of multiple *Phases* and their specific *Treatment Plans* are assigned to *Sessions*. For example, the 1st *Fraction* of SBRT spine, may be treated in the same *Session* as the 3rd *Fraction* of a whole brain. The actual number of *Sessions* required to deliver a *Course* may exceed the number of *Sessions* originally scheduled. This is the case if the treatment in one *Session* cannot be completed due to medical or technical issues and has to be continued in another *Session*. |
