### Usage

This value set is used in conjunction with the [CancerStageGroup] profile. The codes identify the observable associated with the resource and includes tumor stage observables from the SNOMED CT observables hierarchy. The values from this value set appear in the `Observation.code` element.

When staging with a TNM-based system, the more specific profiles [TNMStageGroup], [TNMPrimaryTumorCategory], [TNMRegionalNodesCategory], and [TNMDistantMetastasesCategory] should be used.
