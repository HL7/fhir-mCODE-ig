| *Treatment Plan* |  A plan for radiation therapy using appropriate *teleradiotherapy* or *brachytherapy* treatment modalities, techniques and doses for treating a patient with cancer. | The plan is developed by a team consisting of radiation oncologists, radiation therapist, medical physicists and medical dosimetrists. |
| *Brachytherapy* |  A type of radiation therapy in which radioactive material is placed inside the body, into a tumor or body cavity. | [Reference](https://ncithesaurus.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI_Thesaurus&ns=ncit&code=C15195) |
| *Teleradiotherapy* |  Radiation therapy in which high-energy beams are delivered to the tumor from outside of the body. | Also known as [External Beam Radiation Therapy](https://ncithesaurus.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI_Thesaurus&ns=ncit&code=C15751). |
| *Treatment modality* |   |   |
| *Treatment technique* | |    |
| *Course* | Grouping that collects all radiation therapy treatments constituting an episode of care. This means all target volumes treated from first delivery of radiation in the *Course* until the physician believes they have treated all body sites in need of radiation therapy. | A *Course* can be divided into multiple *Phases* and can last for several months. For example, if there is a split *Course* for liver with 1 month in between, these are all part of the same *Course*. If treatment is started for one body site and then another is subsequently discovered and treated, the *Course* includes both. |
| *Phase* | A conceptual series of equivalent treatments (same nominal dose to the same set of target volumes with the same modality and technique). May use multiple Plans sequentially in case of plan adaptation, or in parallel if splitting plans for technical reasons. | *Phase* is an abstraction from Plans to allow for continuous counting of *Phase Fractions* and dose tracking across multiple Plans that together implement one series of treatments. In the simplest cases, *Phase* corresponds 1:1 to *Plan*.  To realize more complex treatment patterns than a single series of equivalent treatments and vary targets, delivered dose, modality, or technique between sessions, a *Course* can be structured as multiple *Phases*. Often *Phases* are sequential in time, but they may occur in parallel, overlapping, or in alternating temporal patterns. Some systems record a separate *Phase* for each target volume. This is possible but not required in this model. |
| Fraction | Each Radiation Therapy *Plan* is treated in a series of Fractions.  | The term Fraction is also commonly used in the context of a *Phase*, but here we use the separate concept of *Phase Fraction* for clarity when referring to subdivisions of a *Phase.* |
|*Phase Fraction* | Each *Treatment Phase* is subdivided into a series *Phase Fractions*.  | The term *Phase Fraction* is used to clearly differentiate from *Fractions* of a *Treatment Plan*. However, if the context of a *Phase* is clear, then this is often just called *Fraction*. If a *Phase* is implemented by multiple plans that are treated after each other, e.g. in case of plan adaptation, then each *Fraction* of the *Phase* corresponds to one *Fraction* of a *Plan*. If multiple *Plans* are treated in parallel to implement the same *Phase*, then a *Fraction* of the *Phase* contains the *Fractions* of all those *Treatment Plans*.|
| *Session* | Each *Course* is treated in a series of *Sessions*. A *Session* is the period between when the patient enters the treatment room and when they leave it.| In one *Session*, a *Fraction* of one Radiation Therapy *Plan* or different *Fractions* from different Radiation Therapy *Plans* may be treated, depending on how the treatments of multiple *Phases* and their specific Treatment *Plans* are assigned to *Sessions*. For example, the 1st *Fraction* of SBRT spine, may be treated in the same *Session* as the 3rd *Fraction* of a whole brain. The actual number of *Sessions* required to deliver a *Course* may exceed the number of *Sessions* originally scheduled. This is the case if the treatment in one *Session* cannot be completed due to medical or technical issues and has to be continued in another *Session*. |
