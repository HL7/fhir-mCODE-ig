### Usage

Use these terms with the following definitions in mind:

* **Curative** is defined as any treatment meant to reduce or control a disease process, even if a 'cure' is not anticipated.
* **Palliative** includes treatments meant to reduce symptoms and side effects, such as antiemetics.
* **Diagnostic** refers to procedures carried out to identify the nature of an illness
* **Preventive** refers to treatments designed to keep an illness or harm from occurring.
* **Screening** relates to procedures carried out to detect disease in individuals who do not have any symptoms of disease.
* **Guidance** relates to education and counselling, such as smoking cessation programs.
* **Forensic** in the medical context refers to procedures carried out to determine the cause of death.

These values are selected from over a dozen SNOMED terms under the general heading of Intents (nature of procedure values) (qualifier value) (SCT#363675004):

* Diagnostic intent (qualifier value)
  * Staging - procedure intent (qualifier value)
* Forensic intent (qualifier value)
* Guidance intent (qualifier value)
* Palliative - procedure intent (qualifier value)
* Preventive - procedure intent (qualifier value)
  * Prophylaxis - procedure intent (qualifier value)
* Screening - procedure intent (qualifier value)
* Therapeutic intent (qualifier value)
  * Adjunct - intent (qualifier value)
  * Adjuvant - intent (qualifier value)
  * Curative - procedure intent (qualifier value)
  * Neo-adjuvant - intent (qualifier value)
  * Prophylaxis - procedure intent (qualifier value)
  * Supportive - procedure intent (qualifier value)

Here are explanations of why certain terms were **not** included in this value set:

* **Supportive** is slightly more general than palliative, but the latter is more frequently used in oncology. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy#Supportive_therapy> for discussion of the distinction between these two terms.
* **Prophylaxis** is essentially synonymous with preventive. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_healthcare> for the distinction between these terms.
* **Neo-adjuvant** deals with the timing of a treatment relative to other treatments, not the intent. SNOMED's classification of this term is questionable.
* **Adjuvant** also relates to the relative timing of a treatment. Again, SNOMED's classification of this term is questionable.
* **Adjunct** refers to a treatment accompanying or in support of another therapy. This is a situation or circumstance, not an intent.
