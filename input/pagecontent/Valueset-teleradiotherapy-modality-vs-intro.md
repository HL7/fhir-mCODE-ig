### Mapping from Other Vocabularies

The modalities in this value set are drawn from the [radiotherapy code system](CodeSystem-radiotherapy-cs.html) defined in this Implementation Guide. Existing terminology systems do not have all the necessary codes.

The following table shows mappings from SNOMED CT and NCI Thesaurus to teleradiotherapy modality codes. More specific (child) terms in the respective hierarchies also can be mapped to the code in the leftmost column. **This table may not be exhaustive and additional valid mappings may exist.**

| **Code As**    | **SNOMED CT Term**             | **NCI Thesaurus Term**            |
| ---------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| PROTON    | 10611004 Teleradiotherapy protons (procedure) | C66897 Proton Beam Radiation Therapy |
| ELECTRON  | 45643008 Teleradiotherapy using electrons (procedure) | C15650 Electron Beam Therapy |
| NEUTRON   | 80347004 Teleradiotherapy neutrons (procedure) | C15440 High-LET Neutron Therapy |
| CARBON    | Heavy ion teletherapy (procedure) [1] | C160816 Carbon Ion Radiation Therapy |
| PHOTON    | 448385000 Megavoltage radiation therapy using photons (procedure) _or_ 169291001 X-ray beam therapy (procedure) | C93337 High-energy Photon Therapy _or_ C104914 Photon Beam Radiation Therapy |

**Notes:**

1. This a broader term and should be mapped only if it is known from context to represent carbon ion teleradiotherapy.
