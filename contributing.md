# Contributing to mCODE

## 1. Log a HL7 Jira issue

If you have a question, feature request, or proposed change, the best place to start is by logging a Jira issue on the HL7 Jira site. [Instructions for doing this are found here](https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=91982207).

## 2. Discuss with the mCODE team

Once the issue is logged, you should discuss with the team on [chat.fhir.org in the Cancer Interoperability > mCODE topic](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179234-Cancer-Interoperability/topic/mCODE) before attempting to make changes yourself. mCODE changes need to go through the standard HL7 balloting procedure, so it's important to coordinate with the other people working on the project.

## 3. Create a pull request

When everyone has agreed on a course of action, IG changes should be submitted as a pull request for review [in this repository](https://github.com/HL7/fhir-mCODE-ig).

Note that when you create a branch in this repository, CI will build the IG inside automatically. [You can access this here](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mCODE-ig/branches/). 

## 4. Merging

The `master` branch is the primary branch for this repository (shortly to be converted to `main`). Even when a pull request is approved, it may not be merged in immediately. For example, if a change needs to be reviewed by TRG, it may be simpler to wait to merge the branch in until the review is complete in case further changes need to be made.
