The orientation value set is part of BodyLocation, a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.

* Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.
* Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.
* Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
1. Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and
2. Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.

Note that BodyLocation is a data type (a reusable structure), not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).{% endcapture %}{{ md_text | markdownify }}</td>

Conformance note: To be compliant with [US Core Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3/index.html), ICD-10-CM should only be used if a suitable code is not available from SNOMED.

For SNOMED CT coding, use a code from the disorder hierarchy under SNOMED CT 363346000 'Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)' excluding codes descending from SNOMED CT 128462008 'Secondary malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)'. If body location is not precoordinated (i.e., implied by the code), the site of the primary tumor should be specified in the body site attribute.

For ICD-10-CM coding, use one of the codes given in this value set representing primary malignant neoplasms and neoplasms of uncertain or unspecified behavior.

Note that ICD-O-3 specifies morphology and topography, not disorder. If ICD-O-3 is used, the primary cancer disorder code must be specifically be SNOMED CT 363346000  'Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)'.

* ICD-10-CM coding: Use one of the codes given in this value set representing secondary malignant neoplasms and neoplasms of uncertain or unspecified behavior. If body site is not precoordinated (implied by the code), it should be specified separately using the body location.

Note that ICD-O-3 specifies morphology and topography, not disorder; in this case that the disorder code must be SNOMED CT 128462008 (Secondary malignant neoplastic disease). The ICD-O-3 morphology and topography codes should be entered in the HistologyMorphologyBehavior and bodySite fields, respectively.{% endcapture %}{{ md_text | markdownify }}</td>

The full set of allowable clinical and pathologic M categories, along with its current descriptions, can be accessed through the AJCC Staging Manual and any applicable updates and corrections, as well as the AJCC API.

If using SNOMED CT to store M category findings, the use of codes that do not contain descriptions of the categories, such as the examples provided, is encouraged, as stage finding codes in SNOMED CT may not be up-to-date with current AJCC guidance. Note that SNOMED CT codes do not always make a distinction between clinical and pathological classifications (e.g. 'cM0' and 'pM0' may be represented by the same SNOMED CT code 30893008 'M0 category'). In addition, SNOMED CT may not have complete TNM staging terminology and may require supplementation with codes from another controlled vocabulary (e.g. NCI Thesaurus).{% endcapture %}{{ md_text | markdownify }}</td>
