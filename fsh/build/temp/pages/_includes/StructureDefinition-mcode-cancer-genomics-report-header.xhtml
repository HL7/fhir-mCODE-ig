<p>
<p>Genetic analysis summary report. The report may include one or more tests, with two distinct test types. The first type is a targeted mutation test, where a specific mutation on a specific gene is tested for. The result is either positive or negative for that mutation. The second type is a more general test for variants. This type of test returns the identity of variants found in a certain region of the genome.
The identity of non-genomic laboratory tests is typically represented by a LOINC code. However, many genetic tests and panels do not have LOINC codes, although some might have an identifier in NCBI Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), a central location for voluntary submission of genetic test information by providers. To identify the diagnostic report, the name of the report must be in the text sub-field of the code structure. If there is a coded identifier from GTR, LOINC, or other source, then it should be included into the the code sub-field of the code structure. If there is no suitable code, the code can be omitted.</p>
