### Conformance

 MedicationRequest resources associated with an [in-scope patient] and associated with cancer treatment MUST conform to this profile. Beyond this requirement, a producer of resources SHOULD ensure that any resource instance associated with an [in-scope patient] that would reasonably be expected to conform to this profile (i.e., a prescription, administration, or medication exposure) SHOULD be published in this form.
