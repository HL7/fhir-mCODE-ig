### Usage

The following rules apply to this value set:

1. Select the most specific term appropriate for a given situation.
2. Select the term that best describes the technique used, even if that term does not capture every detail of the technique. For example, image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy should be reported as IMRT because that category most closely aligns with the actual technique.

Valid combinations of modality and technique are described in the modality and technique extension [RadiotherapyModalityAndTechnique].

| **Common Usage Name**  | **Definition**|  **SNOMED CT Fully Specified Name**  | **SNOMED CT Concept ID**|
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
|  Two Dimensional Planning (2D)  |  Dose calculated without projection onto 3D imaging and delivered without 3D techniques.  |  Two dimensional external beam radiation therapy (procedure)  | 1156526006 |
|  Three Dimensional Planning (3D)  |  Dose calculated with projection onto 3D imaging (e.g. CT or MR) delivered with either static aperture (Collimator, SRS Cone, Static MLC, blocks, etc) or non-IMRT/VMAT dynamic apertures (e.g. field-in-field, dynamic arc) using either single gantry angles or arcs.  |  Three dimensional external beam radiation therapy  | 1162782007 |
| Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)   | A technique of high-precision radiotherapy that uses computer control to deliver precise radiation doses that conform to a three-dimensional (3-D) shape by modulating the intensity of the radiation beam across the areas irradiated by each of the beams, with patterns designed under computer control to optimize the dose distribution according to a set of limits specified for target, organ at risk, and other structures.   | Intensity modulated radiation therapy (procedure)   | 441799006 |
| Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT)   | A radiation treatment administered during surgery.   | Radiotherapy - intraoperative control (procedure)   | 168524008 |
|  Neutron Capture Therapy (NCT)  | A technique where the patient is injected with a tumor-localizing drug containing a neutron absorber (boron-10), and then radiated with neutrons, which are captured, releasing high-energy alpha particles.   | Neutron capture therapy (procedure)  | 169317000 |
|  Particle Passive Scattering (PPS)  | In proton or carbon ion beam therapy, a technique where the beam is spread out to larger dimension using a scattering device such as lead foil.   | External beam radiation therapy using particle passive scattering technique (procedure)   | 1156529004 |
|  Particle Spot Scanning (PSS)   | In proton or carbon ion beam therapy, a technique where accelerated particles are focused into a small beam and then moved (scanned) over target regions in the patient.   | External beam radiation therapy using particle spot scanning technique (procedure)   | 1156528007  |
|  Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT)   | A type of IMRT technique where the radiotherapy machine rotates around the patient, radiating the target in a complete three-dimensional manner with variable speed and/or dose rate.   | Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (procedure)   | 1156530009   |
