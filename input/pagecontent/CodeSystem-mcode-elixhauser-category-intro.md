### Categories and Codes

Since formal terminologies do not provide codes for individual Elixhauser categories, mCODE provides them. The Elixhauser comorbidity categories represented here and corresponding codes are defined by [Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM v2021.1](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/comorbidityicd10/comorbidity_icd10.jsp). A total of 38 categories are defined.

The comorbidity categories are associated with specific value sets. For example, the category #CHF (congestive heart failure) refers to the patient having a diagnosis that falls within the value set [Elixhauser Comorbid Condition Value Set for Congestive Heart Failure](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/ValueSet/elixhauser-congestive-heart-failure-vs).
