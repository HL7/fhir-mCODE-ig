### Usage

A tumor marker is a substance found in tissue or blood or other body fluids that may be a sign of cancer or certain benign (non-cancer) conditions. Most tumor markers are made by both normal cells and cancer cells, but they are made in larger amounts by cancer cells. A tumor marker may help to diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Examples of tumor markers include CA-125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in colon cancer), and PSA (in prostate cancer). Tumor markers differ from genomic markers in that they are measured at the levels of the protein and substance post-RNA protein synthesis.

### Conformance

Observation resources associated with an [in-scope patient] with an Observation.code in the value set TumorMarkerTestVS MUST conform to this profile. Beyond this requirement, a producer of resources SHOULD ensure that any resource instance associated with an in-scope patient that would reasonably be expected to conform to this profile SHOULD be published in this form, for example, when employing a code that extends the TumorMarkerTestVS value set. Any resource intended to conform to this profile SHOULD populate `meta.profile` accordingly.
