| *Radiation Therapy* | Radiation therapy, or radiotherapy, is a cancer treatment that uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.|  |
| *Brachytherapy* |  A type of radiation therapy in which radioactive material is placed inside the body, into a tumor or body cavity. | [Reference](https://ncithesaurus.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI_Thesaurus&ns=ncit&code=C15195) |
| *Teleradiotherapy* |  Radiation therapy in which high-energy beams are delivered  from outside of the body. | Also known as [External Beam Radiation Therapy](https://ncithesaurus.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI_Thesaurus&ns=ncit&code=C15751). |
| *Treatment Plan* | A plan for radiation therapy using appropriate *teleradiotherapy* or *brachytherapy* treatment modalities, techniques and doses for treating a patient with cancer. The plan contains one set of complete and detailed parameters that define the delivery radiotherapy treatments. | The plan is developed by a team consisting of radiation oncologists, radiation therapist, medical physicists and medical dosimetrists.  The parameters of a *Treatment Plan* include the dose to be delivered to volumes, the number of Fractions into which the treatment is subdivided, *Modality*, *Technique*, as well as the detailed device parameters required by a treatment device. Examples of device parameters are dose rate, field size, or irradiation angles. The *Treatment Plan* covers one set of these parameters. To vary any parameter between Radiotherapy treatments, different *Treatment Plans* must be created and scheduled during a Course of treatment to achieve the expected pattern. Some parameters from distinct *Treatment Plans* are summarized in *Phases* or over a full *Course* of treatment to provide an overview. |
| *Radiation Treatment Modality*    |  The main type of radiation delivery such as photons, protons, or High Dose Rate brachytherapy.|  Modalities are not strictly differentiated along a single physical property, but in a way that makes sense in practical categorization. For *Teleradiotherapy* (external beam radiotherapy) that is along the used particles, for *Brachytherapy*, that is along the dose rate and placement. |
| *Radiation Treatment Technique*    |  The treatment delivery method such as Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy or Particle Spot Scanning. | The *Technique* defines how a certain *Modality* is applied, enabling a more granular categorization of the treatment approach for a given *Modality*. |
| *Course* | Grouping that collects all radiation therapy treatments constituting an episode of care. This means all target volumes treated from first delivery of radiation in the *Course* until the physician believes they have treated all body sites in need of radiation therapy. | A *Course* can be divided into multiple *Phases* and can last for several months. For example, if there is a split *Course* for treatment of a liver cancer with 1 month break in between treatments, these are all part of the same *Course*. If treatment is started for one body site (e.g., left breast) and then another body site (e.g., right breast) is subsequently treated, the *Course* includes both. |
| *Phase* | A conceptual series of equivalent treatments (same nominal dose to the same set of target volumes with the same modality and technique). May use multiple *Treatment Plans* sequentially in case of plan adaptation, or in parallel if splitting plans for technical reasons. | *Phase* is an abstraction from *Treatment Plans* to allow for continuous counting of *Phase Fractions* and dose tracking across multiple Plans that together implement one series of treatments. In the simplest cases, *Phase* corresponds 1:1 to *Plan*.  To realize more complex treatment patterns than a single series of equivalent treatments and vary targets, delivered dose, modality, or technique between sessions, a *Course* can be structured as multiple *Phases*. Often *Phases* are sequential in time, such as a plan adaptation for treatment of the left breast in our example, but they may occur in parallel, overlapping, or in alternating temporal patterns. Some systems record a separate *Phase* for each target volume. This is possible but not required in this model. |
| *Plan Fraction* | Each Radiation Therapy *Plan* is treated in a series of *Plan Fractions*.  | The term Fraction is also commonly used in the context of a *Phase*, but here we use the separate concept of *Plan Fraction* for clarity when referring to subdivisions of a *Plan.* |
|*Phase Fraction* | Each *Treatment Phase* is subdivided into a series *Phase Fractions*.  | The term *Phase Fraction* is used to clearly differentiate from *Plan Fractions* of a *Treatment Plan*. However, if the context of a *Phase* is clear, then this is often just called *Fraction*. If a *Phase* is implemented by multiple plans that are treated after each other, e.g. in case of plan adaptation, then each *Phase Fraction* of the *Phase* corresponds to one *Plan Fraction* of a *Plan*. If multiple *Plans* are treated in parallel to implement the same *Phase*, then a *Phase Fraction* of the *Phase* contains the *Plan Fractions* of all those *Treatment Plans*.|
| *Session* | Each *Course* is treated in a series of *Sessions*. A *Session* is the period between when the patient enters the treatment room and when they leave it.| In one *Session*, a *Fraction* of one Radiation Therapy *Plan* or different *Fractions* from different Radiation Therapy *Plans* may be treated, depending on how the treatments of multiple *Phases* and their specific *Treatment Plans* are assigned to *Sessions*. For example, the 1st *Fraction* of the right breast, may be treated in the same *Session* as the 5th *Fraction* of the left breast. The actual number of *Sessions* required to deliver a *Course* may exceed the number of *Sessions* originally scheduled. This is the case if the treatment in one *Session* cannot be completed due to medical or technical issues and has to be continued in another *Session*. |
