### Conformance

Observation resources associated with an [in-scope patient] with `Observation.code` set to LOINC `21908-9`, `21902-2`, or `21914-7` MUST conform to this profile. Beyond this requirement, a producer of resources SHOULD ensure that any resource instance associated with an mCODE patient that would reasonably be expected to conform to this profile SHOULD be published in this form.
