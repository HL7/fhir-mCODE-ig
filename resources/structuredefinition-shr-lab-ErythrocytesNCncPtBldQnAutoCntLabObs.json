A DomainResource can belong to a single person's health record, or represent an entity that surfaces in multiple records, such as organizations, providers, payments, decision support artifacts, etc.\n\nNote to FHIR implementers: SHR includes Status and Identifier fields on DomainResource because these two attributes occur in almost every FHIR resource. The most significant exception are 3 or 4 resources that use an 'active' flag instead of coded status value. There is no apparent pattern to this inconsistency. FHIR resources that use a coded status have active and inactive as status values. In the spirit of providing a consistent object-oriented logical model for FHIR, SHR uses status across all domain resources.",
