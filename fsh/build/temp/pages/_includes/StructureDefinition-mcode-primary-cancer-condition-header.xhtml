<p>
<p>Records the history of the primary cancer condition, the original or first tumor in the body (Definition from: <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/primary-tumor">NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms</a>). Cancers that are not clearly secondary (i.e., of uncertain origin or behavior) should be documented as primary.</p>
<p>Cancer staging information summarized in this profile should reflect the most recent staging assessment on the patient, and should be updated if and when there is a new staging assessment. Past staging assessments will be preserved in instances of the TNMClinicalStageGroup and/or TNMPathologicalStageGroup, which refer back to PrimaryCancerCondition.</p>
<p>Conformance note: For the code attribute, to be compliant with <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/index.html">US Core Profiles</a>, SNOMED CT must be used unless there is no suitable code, in which case ICD-10-CM can be used.</p>
