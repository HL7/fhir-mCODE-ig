The codesystem identifers TRX, IJE and MRE are not proper codesystem URIs.  Work is underway to define proper URIs that will be included in future versions of this IG.
WARNING: ConceptMap/TG263CM: ConceptMap.group[0].source: The Source Code System TG263 is not fully defined and populated, and no sourceScope is specified, so the source code checking will not be performed

# Reference to condition-category, observation-category, medicationrequest-category code system is inherited from US Core and we can't change that

# Value Set Too Large to Validate
The value set include has too many codes to validate (1,045)
The value set expansion is incomplete

# Use of UCUM inherited from Genomics IG (nothing we can do about it)
WARNING: Observation/gx-genomic-tmb: Observation.value.ofType(Quantity): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {Base} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked, and the Quantity.unit SHOULD contain the annotation

# This is a publisher induced issue.   The extension in question is introduced by the publisher, not sushi.   See https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/New.20ConceptMap.20Warning.20--.20induced.20by.20IG.20Publisher 
The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version {3} is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this element is [[BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)
