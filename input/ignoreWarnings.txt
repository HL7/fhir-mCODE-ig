Target Code System http://snomed.info/sct is only supported on the terminology server, so the target codes are not validated for performance reasons

# Use of UCUM inherited from Genomics IG (nothing we can do about it)
WARNING: Observation/gx-genomic-tmb: Observation.value.ofType(Quantity): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {Base} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked, and the Quantity.unit SHOULD contain the annotation

# TG263 is a terminology managed by the AAPM.  Mapping is included here for documentation purposes.
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/tg263-cs: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
