Recording patient outcomes in mCODE involves disease status, tumor size, and date of death. Other common outcome measures, such as progression-free survival, time to recurrence, and overall survival, can be derived from time-indexed observations of disease status. The date of diagnosis is also required for some derived measures (see [Disease Characterization](group-disease.html)). At this time, mCODE does not include patient reported outcomes.

### Disease Status

Formal recording of disease status is often limited to clinical trials, involving precise criteria such as [RECIST](https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/docs/recist_guideline.pdf). The lack of outcome data outside of trials greatly limits the application of real-world data. Disease status information is rarely found in structured form in EHRs. If recorded at all, the information is found in clinical notes, which is of limited usefulness.

mCODE asks for disease progression to be recorded in structured form as part of patient encounters. In mCODE, disease status is defined as "A clinician's qualitative judgment on the current trend of the cancer, e.g., whether it is stable, worsening (progressing), or improving (responding). The judgment may be based a single type or multiple kinds of evidence, such as imaging data, assessment of symptoms, tumor markers, laboratory data, etc." In other words, the disease status is an assessment by the oncologist that synthesizes all currently available information about the patient. The [ICAREdataâ„¢ Project](http://icaredata.org/) is conducting a study in association with a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which aims to demonstrate the ability to calculate equivalent clinical trial endpoints using computable clinical treatment data.

In addition, the history of tumor size is indicative of treatment efficacy. Profiles for reporting tumor size are new in STU 2.

### Date of Death

Date of death data can be obtained from several sources outside of the clinical setting. If available in the EHR, it can be reported through via mCODE, but more likely, it will be filled in from vital records, after the last clinical interaction.

### Tumor

Two profiles are provided for persistently identifying tumors, which is necessary for comparisons of tumor characteristics over time. The [Tumor] profile provides persistent identification of a tumor that has not been removed from the body. After a tumor has been removed from the body, it MUST be represented by [TumorSpecimen] rather than [Tumor].

If both [Tumor] and [TumorSpecimen] are used to represent the same tumor, `identifier` MUST be used to associate them: a persistent identifier from [Tumor] that is unique within the context of the Patient MUST appear in [TumorSpecimen] with `identifier.type` set to [`tumor-identifier`](CodeSystem-mcode-tumor-identifier-cs.html).

#### Tumor size

The [TumorSize] profile provides a mechanism for recording the dimensions of a tumor. It MUST reference a [Tumor] if the measurement is made while the tumor is still in the body, or [TumorSpecimen] if the tumor has been removed.
