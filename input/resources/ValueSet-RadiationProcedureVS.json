  "description": "Codes describing radiation therapy procedures. The value set includes a limited set of radiation modality codes from SNOMED CT, however, ICD-10-PCS code from Section D (Radiation Therapy) and appropriate CPT radiation procedure codes are also considered compliant. CPT codes are not explicitly included due to licensing restrictions. ICD-10-PCS codes are not included explicitly because they are not currently supported by the FHIR IG Publishing tool.\r\n\r\nConformance note: If an ICD-10-PCS code is used, and a semantically equivalent SNOMED CT or CPT code is available, the resulting Procedure instance will not be compliant with [US Core Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/index.html).",
