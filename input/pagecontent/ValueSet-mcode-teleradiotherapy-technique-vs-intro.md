### Usage

The following rules apply to this value set:

1. Select the most specific term appropriate for a given situation.
2. Select the term that best describes the technique used, even if that term does not capture every detail of the technique. For example, image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy should be reported as IMRT because that category most closely aligns with the actual technique.

### Mapping from Other Vocabularies

The modalities in this value set are drawn from the [radiotherapy code system][RadiotherapyCS] defined in this Implementation Guide. Existing terminology systems do not have all the necessary codes.

The following table shows mappings from SNOMED CT and NCI Thesaurus to of brachytherapy modality codes. More specific (child) terms in the respective hierarchies also can be mapped to the code in the first column. **This table may not be exhaustive and additional valid mappings may exist.**
