Information about the Neuroblastoma INSS Stages can be found at [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2650389/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2650389/).
 
The INRGSS divides neuroblastomas into 4 stages:
* L1: The tumor has not spread from where it started and has not grown into vital structures as defined by the list of IDRFs. It is confined to one area of the body, such as the neck, chest, or abdomen.
* L2: The tumor has not spread far from where it started (for example, it may have grown from the left side of the abdomen into the left side of the chest), but it has at least one IDRF.
* M: The tumor has spread (metastasized) to a distant part of the body (except tumors that are stage MS).
* MS: Metastatic disease in children younger than 18 months, with cancer spread only to skin, liver, and/or bone marrow.

Since there are two main scales, and the initials on them are very close,  it would be good to have something in the narrative that makes it clear which one you mean. 

<i>To ensure data quality, definitions for each value should be provided.  Since the NCI Thesaurus provides definitions, it is easy to add this information.</i>

<i>Hyperlinks to the specific NCI Thesaurus concepts should be included and not just to the general browser site.  This makes it easier for end-users to find the concepts and is consistent with the approach used for other terminologies such as SNOMED.</i>
