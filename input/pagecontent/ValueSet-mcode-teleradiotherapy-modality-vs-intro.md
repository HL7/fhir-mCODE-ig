### Mapping Between Vocabularies

The concepts in this value set are drawn from SNOMED CT or the [radiotherapy code system][RadiotherapyCS] defined in this Implementation Guide. Additional SNOMED CT codes have been submitted for approval. NCI Thesaurus terms are shown for informational purposes.

The following table shows potential mappings. **This table may not be exhaustive and additional valid mappings may exist.**

| **Radiotherapy Code System**    | **SNOMED CT Term**             | **NCI Thesaurus Term**            |
| ---------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| none   | 10611004 Teleradiotherapy protons (procedure) | C66897 Proton Beam Radiation Therapy |
| none  | 45643008 Teleradiotherapy using electrons (procedure) | C15650 Electron Beam Therapy |
| none   | 80347004 Teleradiotherapy neutrons (procedure) | C15440 High-LET Neutron Therapy |
| CARBON    | none [1] | C160816 Carbon Ion Radiation Therapy |
| PHOTON    | none [2] | C93337 High-energy Photon Therapy _or_ C104914 Photon Beam Radiation Therapy |

**Notes:**

1. 312248006 Heavy ion teletherapy (procedure) is a broader term, although today, carbon ions are the predominant heavy ions used in EBRT.
2. 448385000 Megavoltage radiation therapy using photons (procedure) and 169291001 X-ray beam therapy (procedure) are narrower terms and there may be treatment situations involving photons that cannot be described by either term.
