# Noted. SNOMED is the target code system.
Target Code System http://snomed.info/sct is only supported on the terminology server, so the target codes are not validated for performance reasons

# Use of UCUM inherited from Genomics IG (nothing we can do about it)
WARNING: Observation/gx-genomic-tmb: Observation.value.ofType(Quantity): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {Base} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked, and the Quantity.unit SHOULD contain the annotation

# TG263 is a terminology managed by the AAPM.  Mapping is included here for documentation purposes.
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/tg263-cs: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# This valueset is known to be quite large, so inability to validate is not a problem.
INFORMATION: ValueSet/mcode-primary-malignant-neoplasm-disorder-vs: ValueSet.compose.include[1]: The value set include has too many codes to validate (1,046), so each individual code has not been checked

# This issue is a commentary on SNOMEDCT, rather than on the valueset.   ALl values have been checked. 
INFORMATION: ValueSet/mcode-radiotherapy-treatment-location-vs: ValueSet.compose.include[0]: This SNOMED-CT based include has some concepts with semantic tags (FSN terms) and some without (preferred terms) - check that this is what is intended (examples for FSN: [Aortic structure (body structure), Ascending aorta structure (body structure), Branch of brachiocephalic artery (body structure), Carotid artery structure (body structure), Structure of celiac artery (body structure)] and examples for no FSN: [Tumor bed (morphologic abnormality), Scar (morphologic abnormality), Vaginal cuff (morphologic abnormality)])
