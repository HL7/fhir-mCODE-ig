### Usage

When using this value set, the most specific term should be selected. For example, a permanent interstitial implant should be reported as Interstitialâ€“Permanent, never as Interstitial.

The technique used in real life can be more specific than the code used to describe it. For example, interstitial brachytherapy using iridium wire should be reported as interstitial-temporary because that category most closely aligns with the actual technique.

### Mapping from Other Vocabularies

The modalities in this value set are drawn from the [radiotherapy code system](CodeSystem-radiotherapy-cs.html) defined in this Implementation Guide. Existing terminology systems do not have all the necessary codes.

The following table shows mappings from SNOMED-CT and NCI Thesaurus to of brachytherapy modality codes. More specific (child) terms in the respective hierarchies also can be mapped to the code in the leftmost column. **This table may not be exhaustive and additional valid mappings may exist.**
